lastfm2spotify is a collection of hacks to turn charts and loved tracks of last.fm users in to Spotify playlists.
Unfortunately there is no obvious way to manage playlists from scripts, so there is one manual step: pasting the found spotify id's into an playlist.
If you're on a mac the playlist will be on your clipboard after running the scripts, if not, you'll have to edit the scripts slightly
